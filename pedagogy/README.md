#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts, and Data Analysis.
By this experiment we want students to understand the concep t of mechanical energy balance existing in the fluid flows. By doing this experiment they would themselves analyze that if the value of one form of energy is reduced by any means then the value for other form increases. And this is always true for ideal fluid for different flow rates.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Here we have identified three learning objectives. As both the experiments are based on the universal laws for the subjects therefore it includes remembering of the theorem and facts and then operation or execution the experiment. Further during the operation student will be able to understand the theorem and further based on the observations students will be able to to analyse and reach the outcome.

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>recall the Bernoulli’s theorem <br> Next line here. | Remembering | Recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>describe the application of the Bernoulli’s Theorem. | Understand  | Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>analyse the data obtained from various sections at the pipe of different flow rates through graph. | analysing | analyse

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Submmative


1. Switch on the motor
2. Water will move from reservoir to delivery pipe till delivery valve
3. Open the delivery valve
4. Tank, conduit and pipe will fill simultaneously.
5. Once conduit is filled open outlet valve
6. Ask the flow rate
7. Piezometers will start filling up to a certain height.
8. Height of each piezometer is demonstrated and recorded in the observation table.
9. Close the gate valve
10. fluid starts filling in collecting tank
11. After fluid reaches the opening of measuring tube ask to record initial height and start stop
watch.
12. After 30 sec in stop watch stop it. (At this time whole experiment is halted as it is
completed).
13. Ask to record final height.
14. Show the observation table where all the data is recorded in the appropriate columns.
